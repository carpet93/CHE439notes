This 1% compared to the 99% of <sup>12</sup>C neighbors is mostly lost in the noise<br />• In C-H couplings the J coupling is dependent on the s-character (hybridization): J (sp3)&lt;J(sp2)&lt;J(sp)<br />• For <sup>3</sup>J(C,H) there is a Karplus curve<br />• <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>19</sup>F couplings are important as many drugs contain Fluorine<br />   ◇ You can't decouple Fluroine or phosphoryus<br />• If you suspect to have a coupling, go to a different field strength as chemical shift stays the same, but couplings change<br /><br />• DEPT are polarizaiton experiments<br />• The number of DEPT gives the angle of the pulse of the proton<br />• In DEPT90 you only see CH carbons<br />• In DEPT135 CH<sub>2</sub> are negative<br />• In DEPT135 you may not be able to distinguish between CH and CH<sub>3</sub> → Go to DEPT90 where you only see CH<br />• DEPT spectra are polarization transfer experiments<br />• In DEPT you loose the quarternary carbons<br />• The chemical shifts depend on electron density (depend therefore on HOMO-LUMO gap)<br />   ◇ HOMO-LUMO gap is dependent on the reactivity of an atom<br />• Carbon shift decreases with increasing reactivity</div></div>
