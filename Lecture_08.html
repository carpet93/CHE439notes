This would be a problem if you integrate over the signal<br />• The integral is proportional to the very first data points. If the first data points are zero, there is 50/50 positive to negative signals (integral is 0)<br />• We can adjust how steep the function decays and where the maximum is.<br />• LB is responsible for the decay, GB for the position of the gaussian bell maximum<br />• In 2D NMR the sin-bell function is used<br />   ◇ the sign bell is shifted such that the max is at the start of the FID (90°) and it is corrected, such that at the end of the FID the function is zero<br />      ▪ In Bruker this parameter is called ssb<br />• 2D spectra without window functions look very weird as they have not decayed to zero<br /><br /><h2>Baseline Correction</h2><br />• If there is a very strong signal you get bathtub shaped baseline correction<br />   ◇ If it looks like a saddle, the amplifier gain was too high → measure again<br />• The bathtub can be subtracted from a helper function<br />• If the baseline is not corrected, the integrals would be wrong<br />• A sigmoidal-shaped baseline is an often occuring problem, because we have a background signal from the probehead. Some probeheads have some glues, which will be measured when using certain nuclei<br />   ◇ as it is solid, it gets very broad lines → sigmoidal shape<br />• If you see a lot of positive and negative spikes, the receiver gain is too large<br />   ◇ If this is the case, the Analog to digital converter is overloaded (it can handle signals up to 2<sup>16</sup>)<br />      ▪ Everything higher than this will be viewed as 2<sup>16</sup><br />      ▪ This will lead to wiggles<br /><h2>Linear Prediction</h2><br />• If the FID is cut (like in 2D) you can predict the following datapoints (after cut)<br />   ◇ If you have measured 1000 points, you can predict another 1000<br />   ◇ Truncated signals give wiggles<br />   ◇ If you use a window function on a truncated function, you will get broad lines → Prediction is better<br />   ◇ In 1D there is no point, as i can just measure it<br />   ◇ In 2D it is a big help, as you can measure for half the time and predict the second half → it is very fast and yields better resolution<br />   ◇ For this to work it needs to recognize the signal. If the signal to noise is bad, this might not work<br />   ◇ In NOESY (weak signals) linear prediction is mostly turned off<br />• Linear prediction is very important when you have only a few datapoints<br />   ◇ Like in 3D NMR, you often have just 32 datapoints in one dimension and then you can enhance it to 64 which gives a big advantage<br /><br /><h1>Exchange Effect in Spectra<br /></h1>• Some molecules spontaniously isomerize<br />• We have:<br />   ◇ Bond vibrations (too fast for NMR)<br />   ◇ Bond rotations (too fast for NMR)<br />   ◇  Molecular rotations are on the scale of NMR frequencies (10<sup>9</sup>)<br />   ◇ Slower effects will lead to line broadening<br />• If we have a dimethyl-formamide we have two inequivalent CH<sub>3</sub><br />   ◇ They are chemically inequivalent, but as the amide bond has partial double-bond character → rotation is slowed down<br />   ◇ If we heat the sample, the two signals will get broader, melt together and upon further heating become sharp again, but only one peak<br />      ▪ This corresponds to slow, medium and fast exchange<br />      ▪ In fast exchange you lose signals or get very broad signals<br />      ▪ In slow exchange you have seperated signals<br />• Slow exchange: rate for exchange is smaller than difference of chemical shift<br />   ◇ Same thing is true for the coupling differences and the difference of the inverse of transverse relaxation<br />• Coalescence point: point where we go from slow to fast exchange<br />• After coalescence the signal moves to the average position between the signals (dependent on how strong the signals are)<br />• In 1D you may not see Serine and Tyrosine OH- since you are in fast exchange and they are all in the water signal<br />   ◇ Even though OH- of tyrosine and serine have very different chemical shift<br />• Alkaloids (cocaine etc.) yield broad lines since the ring exists in two states whose interconversion is slow<br />• A bad shim can also lead to broad lines or you have something paramagnetic in your sample<br />• In chemical shift not all signals are affected<br />   ◇ If you have a bad shim or something paramagnetic also the solvent peak is broadened<br /><br /><h2>Calculations of rate constants</h2><br />• We have three positibilities to determine k:<br />   ◇ we can do a temperature set of measurements and find the coalescence temp<br />   ◇ we can do a simulation<br />   ◇ we can use the maximal line broadening<br />• Activation energy can be calculated by NMR using the coalescence temperature and the chemical shifts<br /><img src="images/8-1.png" alt="images/8-1.png" /><br />• The problem is how well can i see the T<sub>c</sub><br />   ◇ It is better to do a simulation<br />      ▪ You measure the spectrum at different temperatures<br />      ▪ Then you simulate the spectra at different k until it is the same as the experimental one<br />      ▪ You can get out the k from the arrhenius plot<br />• With 2D EXSY (same as NOESY) will show peaks which intercorrelate from two isomers<br />   ◇ Signals which deviate from the diagonal interconvert with each other<br />• The mixing time parameter in NOE is the time you get the system in EXSY to interconvert<br />• From the intensity of the cross peak to the diagonal you can get k<br /><br /><h2>Saturation transfer</h2> (important)<br />• If i saturate a signal you equally populate alpha and beta state<br />   ◇ If this happens, the signal vanishes<br />   ◇ You can give a pulse exactly on the frequency of the solvent peak → this suppresses the solvent signal<br />   ◇ If i do this on water, the OH-groups exchange with carbohydrates → If we suppress the water, we also suppress the measured carbohydrates<br />      ▪ This is calle dsaturation transfer<br />   ◇ This can lead to complete loss of signal, but will only effect protons that can chemically exchange<br />   ◇ If i saturate A and it is interconverting to B we also affect B<br />• Saturation transfer is important because if you have labile protons in your sample you need to be careful doing solvent suppression<br /><br /><h2>Axial Chirality</h2><br />• If we have two enantiomers we see actually only one signal<br />   ◇ Diastereotopic can also be seen as two different signals (rotation of main c-c bond slow or not possible) due to axial chirality<br />• If we heat up the sample we loose axial chirality and therefore see one signal again<br /><br />• Self decoupling by chemical exchange is it called when we dont see OH protons as it is exchanged with hydrogen from water<br />   ◇ It is 50/50 in alpha and beta state and therefore invisible<br />   ◇ If we decouple H in a carbon spectra we just flip the hydrogen between alpha and beta and back<br />• In Protein NMR you will overtime loose the signal of backbone amides as the N-H becomes N-D in D<sub>2</sub>O<br />• The faster this exchange is, the less protected the N-H is<br />   ◇ If it is involved in a hydrogen bond, it is more protected<br />• Therefore you can calculate protection factors</div></div>
