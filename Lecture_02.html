If a protein is folded it has a stable structure and therefore has a different spectrum.<br />• If a folded protein is put in denaturant its spectrum will become more like a computed spectrum (calculated from the atomic bonds) and there are no anisotropic effects<br />• Scalar coupling results in different number of peaks<br />   ◇ With two couplings you get a triplet if the both couplings are the same<br />   ◇ or when the second one is smaller you get doublet times doublet<br />• For n identical coupling partners: 2*I*(n+1)<br />• For n different coupling partners: 2*I*2<sup>n</sup><br />   ◇ I is the spin (1/2 mostly)<br />• The line intensities behave according to a pascal triangle<br />• Vicinal coupling is <sup>3</sup>J coupling (is a coupling over 3 bonds)<br />   ◇ <sup>3</sup>J coupling is dependent on the dihedral angle → Karplus Curve<br />   ◇ Therefore the size of the coupling is dependent on stereo-chemistry and is used to interpret this<br />   ◇ The Karplus Curve has a minimum at 90° and maxima at 0° and 180°<br />   ◇ If protons can freely rotate, such that the dihedral is averaged, the coupling is also averaged to all gauche conformations (1/3 of each of the gauche conformations). This yields about 7 Hz.<br />• To use this for a stereo-chemical ruler, you can't average out the conformations (like they are in a methyl group)<br />   ◇ This is the case in a ring system (Cyclohexane etc.)<br />   ◇ Axial to Axial is 180° (7-12 Hz)<br />   ◇ Axial to equatorial (gauche) is 60° and smaller (2-5 Hz)<br />   ◇ Axial to Axial is also low (2-5 Hz)<br />   ◇ Cis couplings at a double bond are smaller than a trans coupling (10 vs. 12 Hz)<br />• <sup>2</sup>J are geminal couplings and depend on hybirdization<br />   ◇ sp<sup>3</sup>: -12.4 Hz<br />   ◇ sp<sup>2</sup>: -4.3 Hz<br />   ◇ sp: 2.5 Hz<br />• Couplings can only be observed between protons with a different chemical shift<br />   ◇ Protons with an identical chemical shift will yield a singlet<br />   ◇ Coupling between identical protons can be measured by replacing one hydrogen by tritium (not deuterium since it has a spin of 1)<br />• <sup>4</sup>J are normally not seen (long range coupling)<br />   ◇ You can see them, if the two protons are in a W conformation (looks like a W)<br />   ◇ It helps if you have an additional extended pi-system<br />• Long range coupling are only seen if the peak lines are sharp<br />   ◇ These are normally lost in big molecules like proteins<br />   ◇ Long range couplings are too small to be observed there as the lines broaden<br />• Higher-order spectra are important:<br />   ◇ When you move two signals closer together (measured by v<sub>A</sub>-v<sub>B</sub>/J, chemical shift difference divided by the coupling)<br />   ◇ A large coupling constant occures in a week coupling<br />   ◇ If the both peaks come close together we see a roof effect (inner peaks higher)<br />   ◇ If the difference is 0 it gets a singlet<br />• This is all for an AB-System (two protons which have an identical coupling constant, they are close in ppm)<br />• An ABX System has two coupings such that the peaks are close in ppm and one is far away (X is far away from A)<br />• In an AMX System all spins are far away from each other<br />• We have a strong coupling if the chemical shift difference is closer than 10x the coupling constant<br />   ◇ Strong couplings are rarely the case in organic molecules<br />   ◇ Only aromatic rings show strong coupling<br />   ◇ Aliphatic chains only show weak coupling<br />• If you have a strong coupling on a 300 MHz → Go to a 700 MHz spectrometer (different field)<br />   ◇ 1 ppm equals the MHz number. 0.1 ppm is 30Hz or 70Hz<br />   ◇ Chemical shifts are field independent<br />   ◇ Couplings are field dependent<br />      ▪ You can go to another spectrometer to investigate if you have a doublet or two different peaks<br /><br /><h2>Definitions</h2><br />• A spin system is a non-interupted chain of mutually coupled spins<br />• Chemical equivalence: Atoms, which through symmetry operations can be transformed into each other are called chemically equivalent<br />• For all spins, which are chemically non-equivalent, different letters aof the alphabet are used. The separation of the letters in the alphabet reflects thedifference in the chemical shift (AB vs. AX). The number of chemically equivalent nuclei is annotated as a subscript, e.g. A<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub><br />   ◇ X3 is probably a methyl<br />   ◇ A2X3 could be HO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub><br />• Isochronous nuclei: Nuclei, which by accidence or through chemical equivalence, have indentical resonance frequencies are called isochronous. Cheically equivalent nuclei are always isochronous. There is always a reason for this (symmetry relation)<br />• Magnetic equivalence: Nuclei, which have identical scalar couplings constants to all other spins within the molecule.<br />• Chemically equivalent nuclei need not to be magentially equivalent. In cases where isochronic nuclei are not magnetically equivalent, an additional dash is used, e.g. AA' instead of A<sub>2</sub><br />• Protons on the same carbon (methylen) will only have a different chemical shift if they are diasterotopic<br />   ◇ Homotopic and Enantiotopic protons show the same chemical shift<br />• A CH2 will be different if they feel the chiral center<br />   ◇ It is dependent on how far the CH2 is away<br />   ◇ The next two neighbors to the chiral center usually have 2 signals, the further away just one<br />• Diastereotopic can but not must have two different shifts<br /><br /><br /><h2>Referencing<br /></h2>• The most used internal standard is TMS<br />   ◇ it's 0 ppm in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C <br />   ◇ How do you add the correct amount (very, very little) → Dont put TMS liquid in your solvent<br />      ▪ There is enough TMS in the gas phase of the vial<br />      ▪ Close the NMR tube and shake<br />      ▪ TMS is not water soluble<br />      ▪ TMS is not used for high-temperature NMR as it is volatile<br />   ◇ TSP is another singal<br />• The Solvent signal can also be used for referencing as well<br />• Solvent signal is used if it is temperature stable or you have to correct for it<br />• Water has a pH and a strong temperature dependence.<br />   ◇ There is a formula to calculate the water peak shift at given temperature.<br />• Nitrogen referencing is done in two scales<br />   ◇ amonia<br />   ◇ nitrogen<br />• For Fluorine NMR the Standard CFCl<sub>3</sub> gives 3 signals because there are different isotopes of chlorine<br />• Indirect referencing<br />   ◇ You calibrate the proton NMR<br />   ◇ From this calibration you can calculate the Nitrogen calibration<br /><br /><h2>Shift Reagents</h2><br />• Reagents, that shift ppms<br />   ◇ This is used to separate signals which are close together<br />• Shift reagents are compounds of Eu(fod)3 (Lanthanide complexes)<br />• Chiral Shift reagents are interesting, as (for example Pirkle's reagent) formes a weak complex with your sample and since it has a chiral center you turn your enantiotopic proteins in diastereotopic ones<br />• Moshers reagent is used to determine absolute stereochemistry of alcohols</div></div>
