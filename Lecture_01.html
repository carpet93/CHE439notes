It is called Larmor precession. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession">Wikipedia</a>)<br />• Due to this rotation you have a very small rotating magnetic field vs. a strong constant field of the spectrometer<br />   ◇ You induce a current by changing the field (Magnetic bar in and out of a copper coil)<br />   ◇ The static field does not induce a current in the coil<br />      ▪ But the small rotating field induces the current in the coil<br />      ▪ The current directly measures the presession of the spin<br />      ▪ The current over time goes to zero (relaxation)<br />      ▪ FT of the dammed signal is fourier transformed to determine the frquency of the spin<br /><br /><h2>Setup of a NMR Setup</h2><br />• The magnet in a spectrometer is a copper coil where 110 A of current flow<br />   ◇ This would use up a lot of electricity<br />   ◇ The coil is therefore storred in liquid helium, which has a dielectric constant of 0 and therefore the current flows indefinetly through the coil without being connected to the electricity<br />• At the bottom, there is a probehead, which is another coil as a pole<br />• Inside the spectrometer, inside the probehead, there is a small RF coil, which produces the large magnetic field and is used to record the change in current<br />• The ADC, analog digital converter, converts the physical signal into numbers which then can be fourier transformed<br /><br />• The information we get are<br />   ◇ Chemical shifts<br />   ◇ Scalar couplings constants<br />   ◇ linewidths<br /><br />• The stronger the spectrometer, the higher the precession signal is.<br />• A signal is calculated as a relative distance to the center frequency of 0 Hz.<br />• If the ppm count is higher, it is deshielded and called “downfield”<br />• If the count is lower, it is shielded and called “upfield”<br />• ppm, parts per million, is there because this number needs to be devided by a million<br />• Due to a standard, which can be set to 0, the chemical shifts are the same even in instruments with different strength<br /><br /><h2>Why do Chemical Shifts occur?</h2><br />• Determinants fo the proton chemical shifts are:<br />   ◇ The electron density around the nucleus<br />   ◇ Local anisotropy effect<br />   ◇ Steric effects<br />• The gyromagnetic ratio is spin-specific value (all protons have the same gyromagnetic ratio)<br />• The resonance frequency is defined by the nucleus and the magnetic strength.<br />   ◇ therefore all protons should resonate at the same frequency<br />      ▪ But due to electron density they resonate differently<br />• Teh chemical shift is determined by the electron density aroudn the nucleus<br />• There are electrons around the nucleus of a proton → This changes the nuclear shielding → “Shielding”<br />• The electron density around the nuclei are not the same.<br />   ◇ In an O-H, the proton is less shielded due to withdrawl of electrons towards the oxygen → Hydrogen is deshielded<br />      ▪ OH electrons are at high ppm<br />   ◇ CH protons have lower ppm, since it has more of his electron around himself, and is therefore less shielded against the field. → Hydrogen is shielded<br /><br /><h2>Anisotropy Effects</h2><br />• In a ring you have Pi-Electrons, which start to rotate if a field change is present → Ring current<br />   ◇ When a proton is placed on benzene, it is deshielded by the ring current → aromatic protons are at ppm 7-8<br />   ◇ Protons within the cone (on top of the ring) are in shielded, protons at the side of the ring are deshielded.</div></div>
