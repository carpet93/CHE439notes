If one signal (the one not pertubated) vanishes, there is no NOE, if it is still here, there is an NOE<br />• If the signal gets larger upon an NOE it is a positive NOE<br />• If the signal gets smaller, it is an negative NOE<br />• The temperature experiment (see slides)<br />   ◇ A heated block (A) will cool down<br />   ◇ If a cold block is put next to it (B), the block will cool down faster<br />   ◇ If the distance between the blocks is increased, the cooldown gets slower, but faster than without a block<br />   ◇ If two cold blocks are put next to it, the cooldown is fast and will transfer the energy faster to the one block closer to it<br />• Heating up a block is an analogy to pertubation of a spin for NOE<br />   ◇ Pertubation relaxation takes a long time<br />   ◇ If there are other spins nearby, it will relax more quickly<br />   ◇ Therefore NOE is distance dependent<br />• For the visibility of longe range NOE, short range NOE need to be eliminated as they are far stronger (i.e. by deuteration)<br />• Single quantum transitions dont influence other spins<br />   ◇ If I goes alpha to beta and S goes from beta to alpha, it is a zero-quantum transition<br />      ▪ This changes the intensity of the spins<br />      ▪ only zero- and double-quantum transitions change intensity of other spins<br />      ▪ single-quantum transitions do not have an effect on other spins<br />• The NOE is the fractional change of intensity of the signal<br />   ◇ It is related to the r <sup>-6</sup> and the correlation time<br />• NOE is not only distance dependent but also dependent on motion<br />• The probability on double-quantum and zero-quantum transitions changes with the size of the molecule<br />   ◇ Since the NOE efficiency is given by the difference of double-quantum rate and zero-quantum rate (and they change relative to each other)<br />   ◇ Therefore the NOE is differently efficient depending on moleculear weight<br />   ◇ NOE is positive for small molecules and negative for large molecules<br />      ▪ For large molecules the NOE peaks and the diagonal peaks are both positive<br />      ▪ For small molecules the NOE peaks are negative if the diagonal is positive<br />   ◇ The NOE changes sign depending on molecular weight<br />   ◇ At a certain molecular weight the NOE is zero → you dont see them<br />   ◇ Therefore for small molecules ROSY is used instead of NOE because we dont know if we are at NOE=0<br />   ◇ You can also change the temperature<br />• The error in distance on an NOE is fairly large<br />   ◇ However, we are interested in relative distances but not absolute<br />   ◇ In Protein NMR, every proton has many NOEs to other protons → NOE becomes fairly exact in protein structure determination<br />• </div></div>
