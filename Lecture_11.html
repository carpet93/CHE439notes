If one signal (the one not pertubated) vanishes, there is no NOE, if it is still here, there is an NOE<br />• If the signal gets larger upon an NOE it is a positive NOE<br />• If the signal gets smaller, it is an negative NOE<br />• The temperature experiment (see slides)<br />   ◇ A heated block (A) will cool down<br />   ◇ If a cold block is put next to it (B), the block will cool down faster<br />   ◇ If the distance between the blocks is increased, the cooldown gets slower, but faster than without a block<br />   ◇ If two cold blocks are put next to it, the cooldown is fast and will transfer the energy faster to the one block closer to it<br />• Heating up a block is an analogy to pertubation of a spin for NOE<br />   ◇ Pertubation relaxation takes a long time<br />   ◇ If there are other spins nearby, it will relax more quickly<br />   ◇ Therefore NOE is distance dependent<br />• For the visibility of longe range NOE, short range NOE need to be eliminated as they are far stronger (i.e. by deuteration)<br />• Single quantum transitions dont influence other spins<br />   ◇ If I goes alpha to beta and S goes from beta to alpha, it is a zero-quantum transition<br />      ▪ This changes the intensity of the spins<br />      ▪ only zero- and double-quantum transitions change intensity of other spins<br />      ▪ single-quantum transitions do not have an effect on other spins<br />• The NOE is the fractional change of intensity of the signal<br />   ◇ It is related to the r <sup>-6</sup> and the correlation time<br />• NOE is not only distance dependent but also dependent on motion<br />• The probability on double-quantum and zero-quantum transitions changes with the size of the molecule<br />   ◇ Since the NOE efficiency is given by the difference of double-quantum rate and zero-quantum rate (and they change relative to each other)<br />   ◇ Therefore the NOE is differently efficient depending on moleculear weight<br />   ◇ NOE is positive for small molecules and negative for large molecules<br />      ▪ For large molecules the NOE peaks and the diagonal peaks are both positive<br />      ▪ For small molecules the NOE peaks are negative if the diagonal is positive<br />   ◇ The NOE changes sign depending on molecular weight<br />   ◇ At a certain molecular weight the NOE is zero → you dont see them<br />   ◇ Therefore for small molecules ROSY is used instead of NOE because we dont know if we are at NOE=0<br />   ◇ You can also change the temperature<br />• The error in distance on an NOE is fairly large<br />   ◇ However, we are interested in relative distances but not absolute<br />   ◇ In Protein NMR, every proton has many NOEs to other protons → NOE becomes fairly exact in protein structure determination<br />• There is two types of NOE<br />   ◇ Steady state (saturate until in equilibrium)<br />   ◇ transient (change quickly and look for the response)<br />• In a transient experiment we have a mixing time after inversion<br />   ◇ If this time is 0, we dont see anything<br />   ◇ If the mixing time in a transient experiment is too long, T1 relaxation kicks in and the NOE starts to decay again<br />• In spin diffusion a spin 1 has NOE with spin 2 and 3.<br />   ◇ Spin 3 is between spin 1 and 2<br />   ◇ Therefore upon pertubation of spin 1 it will relax upon spin 3. This is likely to pertubate spin 3 which will relax upon spin 2 and we will see an NOE from 1 to to which is not between 1 and 2<br />   ◇ The bigger the molecule, the more spin diffusion effects occur<br />   ◇ If proton density is high, spin diffusion effects occur as well<br />• In Protein NMR the protein is made in deuterated solvents and is then put into normal water yielding a protein only having N-H<br />   ◇ There is no thrid spin there → Long mixing times available<br />• From the time dependence, spin diffusion can be detected<br />   ◇ Spin diffusion takes some time to build up via the third partner<br />   ◇ Dont use long mixing times when you have spin diffusion<br />• Extreme narrowing occurs in very small molecules (narrow lines)<br />• For proteins, a short mixing time is enough to get a good enough NOE signal<br />   ◇ For small molecules you take a mixing time close to T1 (about 1s)<br />      ▪ In small molecules you dont see large distances very well<br />   ◇ For big molecules you use a mixing time short enough to avoid spin diffusion (experience value)<br />• Spin diffusion peak is not there at short mixing time, it only appears slowly at longer mixing times<br />• As mentioned earlier, you have a zero-crossing in NOE<br />• Therefore ROESY is measured which does not have a zero-crossing<br />• The problem with ROE as you loose all the signal for larger molecules (short T2)<br />   ◇ Proteins are measured with NOE<br />   ◇ small molecules are measured with ROE<br />• ROESY = rotating frame NOE<br />• In ROESY a spin lock is done<br />   ◇ A 90° pulse into the x-axis is made<br />   ◇ Pulses along X-axis are applied to lock the spin in this axis and make it rotate around it<br />   ◇ Cross-Relaxation still works in ROE<br />   ◇ The difference is in the frequency of precession<br />   ◇ In ROE you dont have chemical shift precession<br />   ◇ Frequencies are smaller than NOE (so we are longer on the positive range)<br />   ◇ In ROE the double-quantum frequencies are much lower in ROE</div></div>
